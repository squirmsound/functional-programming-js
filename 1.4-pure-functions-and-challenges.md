## Pure functions and the problem with side effects
Functional programming is based on the premise that we build immutable programs
based on the building blocks of pure functions.

**A pure function has the following qualities:**

- It depends only on the input provided and not on any hidden or external state that may change during its evaluation or between calls.

- It doesn’t inflict changes beyond their scope, such as modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.

_Intuitively, any function that doesn’t meet these requirements is “impure.”_

Programming with immutability can feel strange at first. After all, the whole point of imperative design, which is what we’re used to, is to declare that variables are to
mutate from one statement to the next (they’re “variables,” after all). This is a natural
thing for us to do.

Consider the following function:
```js
let counter = 0;
function increment() {
  return ++counter;
}
```
_Function increment() causes side effects by reading/modifying an external variable, counter. Its result is unpredictable because counter can change at
any time between calls._

This function is impure because it reads/modifies an external variable, counter, which isn’t local to the function’s scope.

In this case, counter is accessed via an implicit global variable (in browser-based JavaScript, it’s the window object). Another common side effect occurs when accessing instance data via the _this_ keyword.

The behavior of _this_ in JavaScript is unlike it is in any other programming language because it determines the runtime context of a
function. This often leads to code that’s hard to reason about, which is why I avoid it when possible. Let's revisit this later.

Side effects can occur in many situations, including these:

- Changing a variable, property, or data structure globally
- Changing the original value of a function’s argument
- Processing user input
- Throwing an exception, unless it’s caught within the same function
- Printing to the screen or logging
- Querying the HTML documents, browser cookies, or databases

If we're unable to create and modify objects or print to the console, what practical value would you get from a program like this? Indeed, pure functions can be hard to use in a world full of dynamic behavior and mutation.

_**Side note: **_ The debugger; is always the better option when debugging values of mutated state. **I learned to embrace the debugger/ (Thank YOU ED CARLIN!)**

**Practical functional programming doesn’t restrict all changes of state; it just provides a framework to help you manage and reduce them, while empowering you to separate pure from impure.**

Impure code produces externally visible side effects like those listed earlier, I have been searching for the best ways to deal with this challenge. I would like to share with you guys.

To talk more concretely about the challenges, suppose you’re a developer on a team implementing an application to manage a ABC television program data.

_S-1.3 - Imperative showProgram function with side effects_
```js
import * as api from 'utils/apiService';
const { programId } = episode;

function showProgram(id) {
  const program = api.getProgram(id);
  if(program !== null) {
    document.querySelector(`#${elementId}`).innerHTML =
    `${program.name}`;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Student not found!');
  }
}

showProgram(programId);
```
This example shows a small imperative program that finds a program's record by program id and renders it in the browser (the use of the browser is immaterial; you could just as easily write to the console, a database, or a file). I refer to and expand this program
throughout this document series as a typical, real-world scenario that involves side effects by interacting with an external local object store (like an array of objects) and doing some level of IO.

Let’s analyze this code further. This function clearly exposes a few side effects that ripple beyond its scope:

- It interacts with an external service `api.getProgram` for data access because the function signature doesn’t declare this parameter. At any point in time, this reference could become null or change from one call to the next, yielding completely different results and compromising the integrity of the program.

- The global variable programId can change at any time, outside our control.

- HTML elements are directly modified. The HTML document (DOM) is itself a mutable, shared, global resource.

- It can potentially throw an exception if the program isn’t found, which causes the entire application stack to unwind and end abruptly.

The function in _S-1.3_ relies on external resources, which makes the code inflexible, hard to work with, and difficult to test.

Pure functions, on the other hand, have clear contracts as part of their signatures that describe clearly all of the function’s formal
arguments (set of inputs), making them simpler to understand and use.

Let’s put our functional shoes on and use what we've learned from the simple print- in previous documents.

Message program against this real-life scenario. As we become more comfortable with functional programming in this series, we’ll continue to improve this implementation with new techniques. At the moment, we can make two simple enhancements:

- Separate this long function into shorter composable functions, each with a single purpose.

- Reduce the number of side effects by explicitly defining all arguments needed for the functions operate its single responsibility.

Let’s begin by separating the activities of fetching the program record from displaying it on the screen. Granted, the side effects from interacting with an external state and the DOM are unavoidable, but at least you can make them more manageable and partition them out from the main logic.

To do this, I’ll introduce a popular FP technique we don't really talk about.

_**currying**_

With currying, you can partially set some of the arguments
of a function in order to reduce them down to one. As shown in the next snippet, we can apply curry to reduce find and append to unary functions that can easily combine via a `compose`, `flow`, or `run` function.

```js
import * as api from 'utils/apiService';
const { programId } = episode;

// The find function needs a reference to the object store and the ID of the program to look up.
const find = curry(function (api, id) {
  const obj = api.getProgram(id);
  if(obj === null) {
    throw new Error('Object not found!');
  }
  return obj;
});

// Converts a program object into comma-separated values
const csv = (program) {
  return `${program.name}, ${program.genre}`;
};

// To display a program's details on the page, you need the elementId and the program data
const append = curry(function (elementId, info) {
  document.querySelector(elementId).innerHTML = info;
});
```

We don’t need to understand currying now, but it’s important to see that being able to reduce the length of these functions lets us write `showProgram `as the combination of these smaller parts:

```js
import run from 'utils/run';
import * as api from 'utils/apiService';

const { programId } = episode;

...

const showProgram = run(append('#programInfo'), csv, find(api));
showProgram(programId);
```

Although this program has been only marginally improved, it’s beginning to show many benefits:

It’s a lot more flexible, because it now has three reusable components.

- This fine-tuned function reuse is a strategy for increasing your productivity, because you can dramatically reduce the footprint of code that must be actively managed.

- We enhance the code’s readability by using declarative style that provides a clear view of the high-level steps carried out by this program.

- More important, interaction with the HTML objects is moved into its own function, isolating the pure from the non-pure (impure) behavior.


This program still needs some tightening, but reducing side effects will make it less brittle to changing external conditions. If we look closer at the find function, we’ll notice it has a null-check branching statement that can produce an exception.

For many reasons, which we’ll study later, it’s best practice if guarantee a consistent return value from a function, making its result consistent and predicable. This is a quality of pure functions called _referential transparency_.

  _A technique using partial evaluation. Currying refers to the process of transforming a function with multiple arity into the same function with less arity. The curried effect is achieved by binding some of the arguments to the first function invoke, so that those values are fixed for the next invocation._

##### Arity
_In logic, mathematics, and computer science, the arity /ˈærᵻti/ ( listen) of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands that the function takes. The arity of a relation (or predicate) is the dimension of the domain in the corresponding Cartesian product._

_The arity property used to return the number of arguments expected by the function, however, it no longer exists and has been replaced by the Function.prototype.length property._
