## Encouraging the decomposition of complex tasks

At a high level, functional programming is effectively the relationship between decomposition
`(breaking programs into small pieces) `and composition `(joining the pieces
back together)`.

The duality makes functional programs modular and effective.

As I have stressed before. The single responsibility principle is a direct line to understand that the unit of modularity, or maybe if it makes more sense to say 'unit of work', is the function itself. This is extremely important and will help us all out if we can adopt this mindset.

Thinking functionally typically begins with decomposition by learning to break a functional task into logical subtasks (functions), as shown in the decomposition of
`showProgram`. This works really well when designing subtasks for a story.

If need be, these subtasks can be decomposed further until you arrive at simpler, pure functions, each of which is an independent unit of responsibility. Remember that this was the thought process I followed when refactoring 'showProgram'. I also used this process when I was modularizing drag n drop.

Modularization in FP is closely related to the singularity principle, which states that functions should have a single purpose; this was also evident in the code for average, shown earlier. Purity and referential transparency encourage you to think this way because in
order to glue simple functions together, they must agree on the types of inputs and outputs. From referential transparency, you learn that a function’s complexity is sometimes directly related to the number of arguments it receives (this is merely a practical observation and not a formal concept indicating that the lower the number of function parameters, the simpler the function tends to be).

All along, I’ve been using run to combine functions to make up whole programs.
It’s time to uncover this dark magic. In reality, run is an alias for one the most important
techniques: composition. The composition of two functions is another function
that results from taking the output of one and plugging it into the next. Assume that
you have two functions f and g. Formally, this can be expressed as follows:
f  g = f(g(x))
This formula reads “f composed of g,” which creates a loose, type-safe relationship
between g’s return value and f’s argument. The requirement for two functions to be
compatible is that they must agree in the number of arguments as well as their types.
We’ll look at this closely in chapter 3. For now, let’s diagram the composition of show-
Student in figure 1.4, this time using the correct function, compose:
```js
const showProgram = compose(append('#programInfo'), csv, find(db));
showProgram(programId);
```
**psuedo**

programId => find(programId) => csv(program.name, program.description) => append(elementId)


The flow of data when composing two functions. The return value from find must be
compatible in type and arity with the arguments to csv, which in turn returns information that append
can use. Note that in order to make the flow of data clear, I flipped the order of the function calls.

Understanding compose is crucial for learning how to implementing modularity and
reusability in functional applications; I discuss this at length in chapter 4. Functional
composition leads to code in which the meaning of the entire expression can be
understood from the meaning of its individual pieces—a quality that becomes hard to
achieve in other paradigms.

In addition, functional composition raises the level of abstraction so that you can
clearly outline all the steps performed in this code without being exposed to any of its
underlying details. Because compose accepts other functions as arguments, it’s known as a higher-order function. But composition isn’t the only way to create fluent, modular
code; in this book, you’ll also learn how to build sequences of operations by connecting
operations in a chain-like manner.
