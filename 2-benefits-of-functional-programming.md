## Benefits of functional programming
In order to benefit from functional programming, we must learn to think functionally
and have the proper tools. In this part of the series, I introduce some core techniques that
I have learned and prove to be indispensable for all of our personal gain in order to develop our functional awareness.

I've mentioned this before and I think its really to make it part of our instinct to look at problems as a combination of composable functions that together, provide a complete solution.

If a concept is hard to grasp now, donâ€™t worry; it will become clearer as as progress through the
rest of the series.

Explore at a high level the benefits FP brings to your JavaScript applications.
The following subsections of this part of the series explain how FP can
- `Encourage you to decompose tasks into simple functions`
- `Process data using fluent chains`
- `Decrease the complexity of event-driven code by enabling reactive paradigms`
