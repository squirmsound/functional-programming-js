## What is functional programming?

In simple terms, functional programming is a software development style that places a
major emphasis on the use of functions. You might say, “Well, I already use functions
on a day-to-day basis at work; what’s the difference?” As I mentioned earlier, FP
requires you to think a bit differently about how to approach the tasks you’re facing.

It’s not a matter of just applying functions to come up with a result; the goal, rather, is
to abstract control flows and operations on data with functions in order to avoid side effects and reduce mutation of state in our applications.

Let's start with a simple JavaScript program that displays text on an HTML page. What better text
to print than the good ol’ “Hello World”:

```js
document.querySelector('#msg').innerHTML = '<h1>Hello World</h1>';
```

* NOTE I mentioned earlier that because functional programming isn’t a specific tool, but a way of writing code, you can apply it to write client-side (browser-based) as well as server-side applications (Node.js).

Opening the browser and typing in some code is probably the easiest way to get JavaScript
up and running, and that’s all we need for this series of documentation.

This program is simple, but because everything is hardcoded, you can’t use it to display
messages dynamically. Say we wanted to change the formatting, the content, or perhaps the target element; you’d need to rewrite this entire expression. Maybe we decide to wrap this code with a function and make the change points parameters, so we can write it once and use it with any configuration:

```js
function printMessage(elementId, format, message) {
  document.querySelector(`#${elementId}`).innerHTML =
`<${format}>${message}</${format}>`;
}

printMessage('msg', 'h1','Hello World');
```

An improvement, but still not a completely reusable piece of code. Suppose you want to write to a file instead of an HTML page. You need to take the simple thought process of creating parameterized functions to a different level, where parameters aren’t just scalar values but can also be functions themselves that provide additional functionality.

Functional programming is a bit like using functions on serious levels of caffeine, because your sole objective is to evaluate and combine lots of functions with others to achieve the best behavior. I’ll fast-forward a bit and show you a sneak peek at this same program using a functional approach.

_ S-1.1 - Functional printMessage _

```js
const printMessage = run(addToDom('msg'), h1, echo);

printMessage('Hello World');
```

So this reads differently than the our original approach. For starters, h1 isn’t a scalar anymore; it’s a function just like addToDom and echo. Visually, we are composing a function from smaller functions.

_The term "scalar" comes from linear algebra, where it is used to differentiate a single number from a vector or matrix. The meaning in computing is similar. It distinguishes a single value like an integer or float from a data structure like an array. ... It could be a number, character, string, or object_

There’s a reason for this madness. S-1.1 captures the process of decomposing a program into smaller pieces that are more reusable, more reliable, and easier to comprehend. Then we combine them to form an entire program that is easier to reason
about as a whole.

#### Every functional program follows this fundamental principle.

For the time being, you’ll use a magical function, run, 1 to invoke a series of functions
sequentially, such as addToDom, h1, and echo. An explaination of run will come with more detail later.

_Behind the scenes, it basically links each function in a chain-like manner by passing the return value of one as input to the next. In this case, the string “Hello World” returned from echo is passed into h1, and the result is finally passed into addToDom._

Why does the functional solution look this way? I like to think of it as basically parameterizing our code so that you can easily change it in a noninvasive manner—like adjusting an algorithm’s initial conditions. Piyush and I were able to fix a handful of bugs with the drag and drop core functionality due to the flexibility that we get for free.

With this foundation laid, you can now easily augment printMessage to repeat the message twice, use an h2 header,
and write to the console instead of the DOM, all without having to rewrite any of the internal logic.

_S-1.2 - Extending printMessage_
```js
const printMessage = run(console.log, repeat(3), h2, echo);

printMessage('Get Functional');
```
This visually distinct approach isn’t accidental, it's intentional. When comparing the functional to the
nonfunctional solution, you may have noticed that there’s a radical difference in style.

Both print the same output, yet they look very different. This is due to FP’s inherent declarative mode of development.
In order to fully understand functional programming, first you must learn the fundamental concepts on which it’s based:

- Declarative programming
- Pure functions
- Referential transparency
- Immutability

#### run()
```js
/*
 * Magical -run- function in support of S-1.1
 */
// -run- with two functions
const run2 = function(f, g) {
    return function(x) {
        return f(g(x));
    };
};

// -run- with three functions
const run3 = function(f, g, h) {
    return function(x) {
          return f(g(h(x)));
    };
};

// Test run function
const add1 = function(x) {return x + 1;};
const mult2 = function(x) {return x * 2;};
const square = function(x) {return x * x;};
const negate = function(x) {return -x;};

const double = run2(add1, add1);
console.log(double(2)); //-> 4

const testRun = run3(negate, square, mult2);
console.log(testRun(2)); //->-16
```

```
const run = (...functions) => x => {
    functions.reverse().forEach(func => x = func(x));
    return x;
};
```

And since run is just an alias for compose, you can also use this:

```js
function compose = ( ...fns ) => fns.reduce( ( f, g ) => ( ...args ) => f( g( ...args ) ) );
```

_Usage_

```js
compose(fn3, fn2, fn1);
```

**Redux has a compose function that looks very similar**


Composes functions from right to left.

This is a functional programming utility, and is included in Redux as a convenience.  
You might want to use it to apply several [store enhancers](../Glossary.md#store-enhancer) in a row.

#### Arguments

1. (*arguments*): The functions to compose. Each function is expected to accept a single parameter. Its return value will be provided as an argument to the function standing to the left, and so on. The exception is the right-most argument which can accept multiple parameters, as it will provide the signature for the resulting composed function.

#### Returns

(*Function*): The final function obtained by composing the given functions from right to left.

#### Example

This example demonstrates how to use `compose` to enhance a [store](Store.md) with [`applyMiddleware`](applyMiddleware.md) and a few developer tools from the [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) package.

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import DevTools from './containers/DevTools'
import reducer from '../reducers/index'

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  compose(
    applyMiddleware(thunk),
    DevTools.instrument()
  )
)
```

#### Tips

* All `compose` does is let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code. Don't give it too much credit!

_Actual Src for compose in redux_

```js
/**
 * Composes single-argument functions from right to left. The rightmost
 * function can take multiple arguments as it provides the signature for
 * the resulting composite function.
 *
 * @param {...Function} funcs The functions to compose.
 * @returns {Function} A function obtained by composing the argument functions
 * from right to left. For example, compose(f, g, h) is identical to doing
 * (...args) => f(g(h(...args))).
 */

export default function compose(...funcs) {
  if (funcs.length === 0) {
    return arg => arg
  }

  if (funcs.length === 1) {
    return funcs[0]
  }

  return funcs.reduce((a, b) => (...args) => a(b(...args)))
}
```
