## Referential transparency and substitutability

Referential transparency is a more formal way of defining a pure function.

Purity in this sense refers to the existence of a pure mapping between a function’s arguments and its return value.

Hence, if a function consistently yields the same result on the same input, it’s said to be referentially transparent.

For instance, the stateful increment
function shown earlier isn’t referentially transparent because its return value is heavily dependent on the external variable counter. Here it is again:

```js
let counter = 0;
function increment() {
  return ++counter;
}
```

In order to make it referentially transparent, we need to remove its dependent state—the outer variable—and make it an explicit formal argument of the function signature.

You can convert it to ES6 lambda form:

```js
const increment = counter => counter + 1;
```

Now this function is stable and always returns the same output when provided with the same input. Otherwise, the function’s return value is being influenced by some external factor which by now we should all agree is not best practice.

We need this quality in our functions because it not only makes code easier to test, but also allows us to reason about entire programs with more ease.

#### Comparing Imperative vs. Functional

_**Imperative Version**_

```js
// This value depends on the initial state of counter and is unpredictable if it changes between calls
changes between calls.
increment();
increment();
print(counter); //-> ?
```

_**Functional Version**_

```js
// This will always increment the initial value by 2.
const plus2 = run(increment, increment);
print(run(0)); //-> 2
```

_Comparison of working with imperative and functional versions of increment. The result of the imperative version is unpredictable and can be inconsistent because the external counter variable may change at any time, compromising the result of future invocations of the function. The referentially transparent functional version is always equationally correct and leaves no room for errors._

**Referential transparency**
or equational correctness is inherited from math, but functions in programming languages behave nothing like mathematical functions; so achieving referential transparency is strictly on us.

Using the magical `run` function again, and seen in previous documentation, `run` shows how to use the imperative versus the functional version of increment.

Programs built this way are much easier to reason about because we can form a mental model of the state of the system and achieve the desired outcome through rewriting or substitution.

Let’s look at this more and assume that any algorithm can be defined as a set of functions that processes a given input and produces an output.

Here, I use pseudo form:
```pseudo
Program = [Input] + [func1, func2, func3, ...] -> Output
```

If the functions `[func1, func2, func3, ...]` are pure, you can easily rewrite this program by inlining the values produced by them—`[val1, val2, val3, ...]`—without mutating the result.

Consider a simple example of computing a student’s average grade:
```js
const input = [80, 90, 100];
const average = (arr) => divide(sum(arr), size(arr));
average (input); //-> 90
```

Because the functions sum and size are referentially transparent, you can easily rewrite this expression for the given input as

```js
const average = divide(270, 3); //-> 90
```
Because divide is always pure, it can be rewritten further using its mathematical notation; so for this input, the average is always `270/3 = 90`

Referential transparency makes it possible to reason about programs in this systematic, almost mathematical, way. The entire program can be implemented as follows:

```js
const sum = (total, current) => total + current;

// Another new function: reduce. Just like map, reduce iterates through an entire collection. By providing a sum function, it can be used to tally the result of adding each number in the array.
const total = arr => arr.reduce(sum);

const size = arr => arr.length;

const divide = (a, b) => a / b;

// we’ll look at ways of combining an average function into a composition.
const average = arr => divide(total(arr), size(arr));

average(input); //-> 90
```

Please note that I don’t plan to apply equational reasoning to every program in this series, it’s important to understand that this is implicit in any purely functional program, and I've learned that it wouldn’t be possible if functions had side effects. We'll come back to
the importance of this principle in the context of unit testing functional code. Defining all function arguments up front avoids side effects in most cases, as with scalar values; but when objects are passed by reference, we must be cautious not to inadvertently
mutate them.
