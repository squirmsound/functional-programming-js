## Preserving immutable data
Immutable data is data that can’t be changed after it’s been created.
In JavaScript, as with many other languages, all primitive types
`(String, Number, and so on)`
are inherently immutable.

But other objects, like arrays, aren’t immutable; even if they’re passed as input to a function, you can still cause a side effect by changing the original content. Let me show an example with a simple array-sorting function:

```js
const sortByDescending = function (arr) {
  return arr.sort(function (a, b) {
    return b - a;
  });
}
```

At a glance, this code seems perfectly fine and side effect–free. It does what we’d
expect it to do.
We provide an array, and it returns the same array sorted in descending order:
```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
sortByDescending(arr); //-> [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```
Unfortunately, the Array.sort function is stateful and causes the side effect of sorting
the array in place.

The original reference is changed.

This is a serious flaw in the language and one that we are oblicated to overcome.

Now that I’ve had a chance to expose you to a portion of the fundamental principles behind functional
programming (declarative, pure, and immutable), I want to thank you for going this far. I know that it
can be a challenge to digest all of this information. I hope that if you have any questions you don't hesitate to ask.
Please create an issue on the git repo with your questions and I will respond as soon as time permits.

Now allow me to express more briefly:
_functional programming refers to the declarative evaluation of pure functions to create
immutable programs by avoiding externally observable side effects_.

Not such a mouthful after all. We’re only scratching the surface in terms of the practical benefits of writing functional
applications, but by now we are beginning to understand what it means to think with this mindset.

Most of the issues we face nowadays are due to the heavy use of large functions that rely greatly on externally shared variables, do lots of branching,and have no clear structure.

I think that we can all agree that this is the situation for many JS applications today.
Even successful ones made up of many files that execute together, forming a shared mesh of mutable, global data that can be hard to track and debug.

Being forced to think in terms of pure operations and looking at functions as
frozen units of work that never mutate data can definitely reduce the potential for
bugs.

Understanding these core principles is important in order to reap the benefits
functional programming brings to your code, which will guide you on the path to
overcoming complexity.

Now let's talk more about the benefits of functional programming.
