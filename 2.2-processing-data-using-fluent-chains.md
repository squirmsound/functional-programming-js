## Processing data using fluent chains
In addition to map, you can import a repertoire of many higher-order functions into
any JavaScript project through some powerful and optimized functional libraries. In
chapters 3 and 4, I give a tour of many of these higher-order functions implemented
in popular JavaScript functional toolkits like Lodash.js and Ramda.js; they overlap in
many aspects, but each brings unique features that can facilitate assembling function
chains.
If you’ve written some JQuery code before, you’re probably familiar with this
idiom. A chain is a sequential invocation of functions that share a common object
return value (such as the $ or jQuery object). Like composition, this idiom allows you
to write terse and concise code, and it’s typically used a lot in functional as well as reactive
programming JavaScript libraries (more on this later). To show this, let’s tackle a
different problem. Suppose you’re tasked with writing a program that computes the
average grade for students who have enrolled in more than one class. Given this array
of enrollment data
```js
let enrollment = [
{enrolled: 2, grade: 100},
{enrolled: 2, grade: 80},
{enrolled: 1, grade: 89}
];
an imperative approach might look like this:
var totalGrades = 0;
var totalStudentsFound = 0;
for(let i = 0; i < enrollment.length; i++) {
let student = enrollment [i];
if(student !== null) {
if(student.enrolled > 1) {
totalGrades+= student.grade;
totalStudentsFound++;
}
}
}
var average = totalGrades / totalStudentsFound; //-> 90
```
Just as before, decomposing this problem with a functional mindset, you can identify
three major steps:
■ Selecting the proper set of students (whose enrollment is greater than one)
■ Extracting their grades
■ Calculating their average grade

Now you can use Lodash to stitch together functions representing these steps, forming
a functional chain, as shown in listing 1.5 (for a full explanation of what each of
these functions does, you can visit the appendix for directions on where to find the
proper documentation). A function chain is a lazy evaluated program, which means it
defers its execution until needed. This benefits performance because you can avoid
executing entire sequences of code that won’t be used anywhere else, saving precious
CPU cycles. This effectively simulates the call-by-need behavior built into other functional
languages.
```js
_.chain(enrollment)
.filter(student => student.enrolled > 1)
.pluck('grade')
.average()
// Calling _.value() kicks off the execution of all operations in the chain.
.value(); //-> 90
```
