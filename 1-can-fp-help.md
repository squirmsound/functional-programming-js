Can functional programming help?
Learning functional programming has never been as important as it is today. The
development community and major software companies are starting to realize the
benefits of using FP techniques to power their business applications. Nowadays, most
major programming languages (Scala, Java 8, F#, Python, JavaScript, and many more)
provide either native or API-based functional support. Hence, FP skills are in high
demand now and will continue to be in the years to come.
In the context of JavaScript, an FP mindset can be used to shape the incredibly
expressive nature of the language and help you write code that is clean, modular, testable,
and succinct so that you can be more productive at work. For many years, we’ve
neglected the fact that JavaScript can be written more effectively in a functional style.
This neglect is partly due to an overall misunderstanding of the JavaScript language,
and also due to JavaScript’s lack of native constructs to properly manage state; it’s a
dynamic platform that places the burden of managing this state on us (the ones
responsible for introducing bugs into our applications). This may work well for small
scripts, but it becomes harder to control as your code base grows. In a way, I think FP
protects you from JavaScript itself. I discuss this further in chapter 2.
Writing functional JavaScript code addresses most of these concerns. Using a set of
proven techniques and practices based on pure functions, you can write code that is
easy to reason about in the face of increasing complexity. Writing JavaScript functionally
is a two-for-one deal, because you not only improve the quality of your entire
application, but also gain more proficiency in and a better understanding of the
JavaScript language.
Because functional programming isn’t a framework or a tool, but a way of writing
code, thinking functionally is radically different from thinking in object-oriented
terms. But how do you become functional? How do you begin to think functionally?
Functional programming is intuitive once you’ve grasped its essence. Unlearning old
habits is the hardest part and can be a huge paradigm shift for most people who come
from an object-oriented background. Before you can learn to think functionally, first
you must learn what FP is.
